# AlexNet-CUDA-implementation
This project simply shows how to implement a pre-trained AlexNet model structure (extracted from pytorch model library) using CUDA.

For now, it only contains the implementation of the first convolution layer of a pre-trained AlexNet model. The remaining features will be updated continuously.
